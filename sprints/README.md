# Sprints Directory

This directory contains sprint-specific backlogs and tracking documents.

## Structure

Each sprint has its own markdown file:
- `sprint-01.md` - First sprint (Project Foundation)
- `sprint-02.md` - Second sprint
- `sprint-03.md` - Third sprint
- etc.

## Sprint Naming Convention

Format: `sprint-XX.md` where XX is the sprint number (01, 02, 03...)

## Creating a New Sprint

1. Copy the sprint template:
   ```bash
   cp ../SPRINT_BACKLOG_TEMPLATE.md sprints/sprint-XX.md
   ```

2. Update the sprint file with:
   - Sprint number and dates
   - Sprint goal
   - Team capacity
   - Selected backlog items from PRODUCT_BACKLOG.md

3. Track progress daily:
   - Update daily standups
   - Move items through status
   - Flag blockers

4. Complete sprint retrospective at the end
